A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x\$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

---

Based on the above requirement I built this application with a default of 2 users generated by application.

There is an input field allows to add a new user as many as needed. When a user is created system generates spent money randomly in a range from $1 to $150.

This application is not using database and all data generates by the system.

Then the system calculates how many points earned from each transaction and displays the transaction result on the screen. On the screen you can see only name and amount of points.
When you click on the user on the page an information page slides in from the right side and you can see a list of transactions and points earned from each transaction.

User can close info page using x control on the left of the page. I tried to keep the code as simple as possible.

This sample application developed with reactjs
